## Getting Started

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
